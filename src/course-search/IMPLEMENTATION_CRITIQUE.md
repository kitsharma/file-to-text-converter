## Areas for Improvement (8.5 → 10/10)

### 1. **Performance Optimizations** 
```javascript
// Current: All data loaded on mount
// Improvement: Lazy load opportunities data
const LazyOpportunitiesList = React.lazy(() => import('./OpportunitiesList'));

// Current: No image optimization
// Improvement: Add placeholder images for courses
```

### 2. **Enhanced Accessibility**
```javascript
// Missing: Skip links for keyboard navigation
<a href="#main-content" className="sr-only focus:not-sr-only">Skip to content</a>

// Missing: Screen reader announcements for dynamic content
const [announcement, setAnnouncement] = useState('');
// Add live region for plan generation status
```

### 3. **SEO and Meta Tags**
```html
<!-- Missing structured data -->
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "WebApplication",
  "name": "AI Career Insights Platform"
}
</script>
```

### 4. **Advanced Error Recovery**
```javascript
// Current: Basic error boundaries
// Improvement: Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
const useRetryFetch = (url, maxRetries = 3) => {
  // Implement retry logic
};
```

### 5. **Analytics and Monitoring**
```javascript
// Missing: User interaction tracking
const trackUserAction = (action, properties) => {
  // Analytics implementation
};

// Missing: Performance monitoring
const reportWebVitals = (metric) => {
  // Performance tracking
};
```

## Security Considerations
✅ **Well Implemented**
- No hardcoded API keys or secrets
- Proper CORS configuration
- Input sanitization in serverless functions
- Safe external link handling with rel="noopener noreferrer"

⚠️ **Could Enhance**
